This is a very basic plugin to simple toggle the status of your posts between publish and post

== Description ==

I searched internet on publishing my multipe posts in draft and the basic procedure of wordpress is not fast . so I made a simple plugin where you can make change status of multiple post/pages from publish to draft and draft to publish.

A menu tab OneClickPublish will appear on admin menu after installation . You will see table view of all the posts that are published and another table view which will show the list of all posts in draft . 

Just select the post rows and click on publish/draft button and all the posts will be published/drafted . 

If you have some other idea that can be implemented in this plugin then please mail me at nk@no-kt.com


== Installation ==

1. Upload `oneclickpublish` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You can see all the published and drafted post/pages list in plugin menu . Just click on the "publish it" button to publish it and "draft it " button to draft it . 
MULTIPLE CLICKS CAN BE MADE TO PUBLISH/DRAFT MULTIPLE POST
