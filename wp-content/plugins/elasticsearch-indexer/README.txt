Aside from super fast full text search, this plugin will speed up post listings of any post type, including WooCommerce products.

== Description ==

A plugin that integrates [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

Aside from super fast full text search, this plugin will speed up post listings of any post type, including [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) products.

The plugin works by indexing all posts and post meta data and redirecting the requests by WordPress from MySQL to Elasticsearch.

The plugin requires that you have installed Elasticsearch on the local server or a remote server.

[View the project on Github](https://github.com/wallmanderco/elasticsearch-indexer) for more info.

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'elasticsearch-indexer' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. [Install Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_installing_elasticsearch.html) if you haven't already.
1. Make sure that Elasticsearch is installed and running on your server  
(You can test this by running `curl -XGET -i 'http://127.0.0.1:9200'` in the command line)

1. Click on the new menu item and press the button “Reindex all posts”.
