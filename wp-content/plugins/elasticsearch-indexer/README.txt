Aside from super fast full text search, this plugin will speed up post listings of any post type, including WooCommerce products.

== Description ==

A plugin that integrates [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

Aside from super fast full text search, this plugin will speed up post listings of any post type, including [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) products.

The plugin works by indexing all posts and post meta data and redirecting the requests by WordPress from MySQL to Elasticsearch.

The plugin requires that you have Elasticsearch installed on your server
