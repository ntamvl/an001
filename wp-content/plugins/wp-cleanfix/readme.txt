WPX CleanFix Light is the "light" version of wpXtreme [CleanFix](https://wpxtre.me/product/wpx-cleanfix).
CleanFix is a plugin born to improve the core features within your WordPress installation and keep clean your databases with ease
This plugin is the perfect fit for anybody who needs to get rid of the annoyances database management which regularly rises and for those who need to literally clean their WordPress up from missing categories, users, meta, etc.

CleanFix embodies several functions, which normally are provided as single plugins, and make them all quickly and easily available through a clean dashboard for the website management (for specific information see the features tab).
A clean and simple UI lets you enable/disable every single feature quickly and smoothly with just a click. Since CleanFix takes advantage of Ajax, you’ll be able to perform simultaneously multiple actions without refreshing your page.
